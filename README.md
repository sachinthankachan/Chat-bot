# Chat-bot
It's a simple chat bot in Python that can answer simple questions and gather information from Wikipedia.

## features
- can say the day and time
- can take random number or letter(in English)
- can countdown
- search unknown words on Wikipedia

## notes
- avoid what,where..etc for getting results from Wikipedia
- the bot can't answer all the questions,but you can increase the ability by adding new condition statements
- sometimes it doesn't search for the right thing in the Wikipedia. So make sure you are using the right keyword
- eg:- if you ask for apple(fruit) it may give results about apple(company). Instead ask for "apple fruit".
